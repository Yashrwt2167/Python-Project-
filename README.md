# 🎬 Netflix Movie Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes a Netflix movie dataset using Python and visual libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to understand content trends based on genres, vote averages, and release years.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset (`mymovie.csv`) contains:
- Movie Titles
- Genre(s)
- Vote Average
- Release Date
- Popularity score
- Other metadata

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed duplicate and null values
- Converted release date to year
- Split genre column and expanded into multiple rows
- Converted genre to categorical type

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Genre-wise count plot to see most common genres
- Vote average distribution
- Popularity analysis (most/least popular movies)
- Release year histogram

## 📌 Key Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📈 Insights
- Identified which genres are most produced
- Found most/least popular movies
